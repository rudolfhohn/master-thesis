The goal of this thesis is to analyze the state-of-the-art of conversational agents (chatbots) and what is pragmatically possible today in terms of business applications and what are the next big problems research has to address. Chatbots made a "buzz" in the media and in the industry by bringing a new way for businesses to communicate with customers. Although chatbots exist since 1970s, only recently engineers were able to provide an enough good user experience and use the chatbots as a interaction channel between the customer and the company. Being robust, understanding and reliable are the keys to attract customers using the chatbots.

We also see new forms of User Experience requirements. Ergonoms and information visualisation specialists worked very hard these past 20 years to provide best practices for desktop, web and mobile applications to let people enjoy the use of the application. However, with chatbots the main interaction relies on direct communication which rises new requirements that scripts from movie and theaters industries can bring their knowledge to create and imagine the ``correct'' way of discussing with a customer depending on its age, its culture or its gender. Character development and character management are new challenges and new jobs that rise with new chatbots~\citep{1704.04579}.

% The model architecture baseline uses a machine translation model architecture. However, instead of translating from a language to another (e.g. French to English), the model ``translates'' a sentence to another sentence and overall creates a conversational agent, a machine with discussing capabilities.

Chatbots are everyday present in our lives. Apple, Amazon, Google all have their advanced chatbots with different capabilities. For example, an iOS user can ask Siri to add a reminder, send a message or even, when coupled with domotics, turn off lights. Other businesses create chatbots to improve customer experience when selling services or products or booking a hotel or a flight. Facebook Messenger have created a developer-friendly interface to help businesses and people create a chatbot and enable it for all the 1.37 billion daily active users Facebook has~\citep{facebook3rdquarter2017}. Dialogflow is an application that manages the backend of a chatbot. A developer uses their services to create scenarios and prepare the answers, the application will take care of all the natural language processing (NLP) and provide an intelligent conversational agent.

These commercial applications are possible thanks to the research done in both NLP and deep learning fields in recent years. The two main approaches of constructing a chatbot are the markup language approach and the generative approach. The first one exists for more than 20 years and has limitations. Developers write down all the possible sentences the chabot can encounter and provide the related answer. The first main issue rises when the user does not use the exact same language or write a sentence differently from what the developer planned and the chatbot is no longer able to answer. The language used for these type of chatbot is known as the Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). The most known chatbot powered by AIML is Alice \texttt{ref needed}. \textit{explain what it can do}.

The generative approach has appeared recently and take advantage of the progress in Machine Learning (ML) and more particularly of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The idea of the generative models uses the underlying idea of any ML models ; given a lot of data, the model will be able to learn the data and predict a value for any input. Basically, when a user sends a text to a chatbot, the text becomes the input of the ML model which generates an answer based on what it learned, and the chatbot responds to the user. The main advantage, which also answers the main issue of the markup language approach, is that the model does not need the exact wished text, it can understand synonyms, different sentence constructions and still understand the will of the user. However, the main disadvantage is the quantity of data needed to train a DNN model. Millions of examples are needed to train a generative model.
