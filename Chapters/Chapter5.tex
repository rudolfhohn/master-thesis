This thesis proves that end-to-end open-domain chatbot is not yet possible. The closest open-domain chatbot is today a toolbox of independant conversational agents controlled by a dialogue manager, like Siri or Alexa. Truly open-domain chatbot might resemble to conciousness, a machine having stored enough knowledge to discuss anything with anyone, having its own opinions. The rising question is: when is it correct? There are opinions as many there Humans on Earth, maybe that before trying to develop such a chatbot, assuming that one day it will be possible, we can try asking ourselves, how could we define its personality?

Besides dreams, ground-level scientific work is trying to push the limits of todayâ€™s chatbots and to bring a truly personnal assistant, capable of many things except thinking.
